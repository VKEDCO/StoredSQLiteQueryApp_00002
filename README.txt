1) Eclipse Project (StoredSQLiteQueryApp_00001.rar) with an Android (Android 2.3.3) 
app that creates an SQLite database (math_info.db) with one table (mathematician), 
populates it with entries for twelve famous mathematicians (Muhammad al-Kwarizmi, 
Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Blaise Pascal, Andrey Kolmogorov, Isaac Newton, 
Nikolay Lobachevsky, Georg Cantor, David Hilbert, Giuseppe Peanno, Kurt Godel, 
Alonzo Church), and allows the user to search the database by the mathematicians' 
research areas and countries.
